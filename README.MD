# DATA DEMO

The Data Demo [generates fake data](https://fakerjs.dev/) aligned with the ERD below.

The Data Demo can throw data into the following environments -

1) [Local Kafka (Confluent) (Docker)](#confluent)
2) [Local Kafka (Redpanda) (Docker)](#redpanda)
3) [Local Postgres (Docker)](#postgresql)
4) [Local Postgres -> Kafka Connect -> Kafka (Docker)](#postgresql--kafka)
5) [Confluent Cloud](#confluent-cloud) ([tf-ccloud](./tf-ccloud/README.md))

For more details on running the Data Demo, jump ahead to the [getting started section](#getting-started) after installing the [prerequisites](#environment-prerequisites).

## Environment Prerequisites

* [git](PREREQS.MD#git)
* [Java 21](PREREQS.MD#java-21)
* [Docker](PREREQS.MD#docker)
* [IDE](PREREQS.MD#ide)
  * [SDK Setup](PREREQS.MD#project-sdk-configuration) & [Lombok Config](PREREQS.MD#enable-annotation-processors-for-lombok)
* [jq](PREREQS.MD#jq) (optional)

## Getting Started

1. In the [root gradle.properties](./gradle.properties) file, select your `runtimeMode` (brief descriptions below).
   * `postgres`: data-demo will inject mock data into a local postgres database.
   * `kafka`: data-demo will produce mock data into Kafka. A redis cache is used to keep track of the produced mock entities.
   * `kafka-cloud`: data-demo will connect to a Confluent Cloud cluster and produce mock data. A local redis cache is still used to keep track of the produced mock entities.
2. Start the [environment](#local-environments) for your selected `runtimeMode`
   * [Kafka](#confluent)
   * [Redpanda](#redpanda)
   * [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
   * [Confluent Cloud](#confluent-cloud)
   * [Tracing](#tracing)
3. If you're enabling tracing, start the [tracing environment](#tracing) and set `tracingEnabled=true` in the [`gradle.properties`](./gradle.properties) file.
4. Configure the initial load volumes (these do not apply if running the `mockdata-api`). These properties are in the [`gradle.properties`](./gradle.properties) file.
   ```properties
   initialLoadCustomers=20
   initialLoadArtists=20
   initialLoadVenues=15
   initialLoadEvents=100
   initialLoadTickets=10000
   initialLoadStreams=50000
   ```
5. Run `data-demo`. There are 2 modes of operation, a daemon and an API. More details can be found on each below.
   1. `mockdata-daemon`, run via `./gradlew bootRunDaemon`
      * The daemon will hydrate the configured initial load volumes and then continue to run and inject random data into the environment.
   2. `mockdata-api`, run via `./gradlew bootRunAPI`
      * The API exposes endpoints to manually create entities. Import the [Insomnia Collection](./assets/DataDemo_Insomnia_2022-10-20.json) to explore the available endpoints.
        * To validate the API, you can fire off a sample request with this command -> `curl -X POST localhost:8080/customers | jq`

## Local Environments

The `docker-compose` gradle plugin is used to start the services in appropriate docker-compose files.

### Confluent

1. Start [Kafka Services](./kafka/local/cluster/docker-compose-confluent.yml)

  * Typical set-up of 3 brokers with replication of data between brokers. 
    ```bash
    # KAFKA
    ./gradlew kafkaComposeUp
    ./gradlew kafkaComposeDown
    ./gradlew kafkaComposeDownForced
    ```

  * Minimal set-up of 1 broker (use on limited hardware)
    ```bash
    # KAFKA
    ./gradlew kafka1ComposeUp
    ./gradlew kafka1ComposeDown
    ./gradlew kafka1ComposeDownForced
    ```

2. Validate Environment

* In each directory there is a bin directory of kafka command line tools. These are actually scripts to run the command on the broker (to avoid additional software installed on your machine).

* Be sure to run from either `kafka-1` or `kafka-3` as container names are different between them.

* `./bin/kafka-topics --list`
  * Will list all the topics on the cluster, you should see 5 topics in a newly created cluster. `__consumer_offsets` is a topic internally created for Kafka. `_schemas` 
  is used by the schema-registry which is used for data governance. `connect-cluster-*` topics will be used by the **Kafka Connect** service that will be used to connect
  Kafka to external systems.

  ``` 
  __consumer_offsets
  _schemas
  connect-cluster-config
  connect-cluster-offsets
  connect-cluster-status
   ```

* `./bin/kafka-topics --create --topic test --partitions 2`

* `./bin/kafka-console-producer --topic test`

  * each line you type will create a message to a topic
  * hit `ctrl-d` to exit
  
* `./bin/kafka-console-consumer --topic test --from-beginning`

  * Each line sent sent by the producer will show up here in the consumer.
  * `--from-beginning` will have it start with the earliest message, omitting this means it will only display messages after it is started.

* Starting a producer and consumer in two separate consoles is the best way to start seeing how Kafka works.
 
  * Advance concepts to be learned through the course will be:
    * Keys for Messages
    * Partitioning of Messages
    * Replication of Messages
    * Consumer Groups
    
2. Validate Environment
   - If all containers seem to be running (healthy), navigate to [Control Center](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/index.html) at http://localhost:9021 and poke around a bit. You should see a few things but feel free to explore as much as you want. 
     - A single cluster named "controlcenter.cluster"
     - When clicking on the "controlcenter.cluster" cluster, 1 Broker 
     - When clicking on Topics, No Topics 
       - If you unselect "Hide internal topics", you should see the topics used by CC itself to manage its own state.

### Redpanda

1. Start [Kafka Services](./kafka/local/cluster/docker-compose-redpanda.yml)
   - [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) is a *Kafka-compatible* streaming data platform that is JVM-free & ZooKeeperÂ®-free. It starts fast and requires fewer resources, making it great for local environments.
    
    ```bash
    # KAFKA
    ./gradlew redpandaComposeUp
    ./gradlew redpandaComposeDown
    ./gradlew redpandaComposeDownForced
    ```

2. Validate Environment 
   * [Redpanda Console](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console) available at `http://localhost:3000`
   
### PostgreSQL

1. Start [Postgres Services](./postgres/local/docker-compose.yml)

   ```bash
   # POSTGRESQL
   ./gradlew postgresComposeUp
   ./gradlew postgresComposeDown
   ./gradlew postgresComposeDownForced
   ```

2. Validate Environment
    * pgAdmin4 (Postgres Exploration UI) available at `http://localhost:5433`
        * username: `root@email.com`
        * password: `root`
        * postgres database password: `postgres`
        
### PostgreSQL + Kafka

If you're planning to load data from Postgres into Kafka via Kafka Connect, run the following commands.

1. Start All Services ([Postgres](./postgres/local/docker-compose.yml) & [Kafka](./kafka/local/cluster/docker-compose-confluent.yml))

    ```bash
    ./gradlew fullComposeUp
    ./gradlew fullComposeDown
    ./gradlew fullComposeDownForced
    ```

2. Validate Environment
   * Postgres
     * pgAdmin4 (Postgres Exploration UI) available at `http://localhost:5433`
        * username: `root@email.com`
        * password: `root`
        * postgres database password: `postgres`
   * Kafka
       * [Redpanda Console](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console) available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Confluent Cloud

The Confluent Cloud environment is provisioned via Terraform. You will need the Confluent CLI installed and logged in.

1) Provision Confluent Cloud Environment - see the [tf-ccloud readme](./tf-ccloud/README.md) for more details.
2) After the environment is provisioned, configure the bootstrap-servers, api-key, and api-secret. These values are expected by the [application-ccloud.yaml](./kafka/src/main/resources/application-ccloud.yaml) properties file.
   ```bash
   terraform output resource-ids
   
   export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER="pkc-mg1wx.us-east-2.aws.confluent.cloud:9092"
   export DATA_DEMO_CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY="**REDACTED**"
   export DATA_DEMO_CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET="**REDACTED**"
   ```
3) You will still need to start Redis locally, as it is needed by data-demo for caching the created entities. This allows the tool to generate data with referential integrity.
    ```bash
    ./gradlew redisComposeUp
    ./gradlew redisComposeDown
    ./gradlew redisComposeDownForced
    ```
4) Redis Commander available at http://localhost:6380

### Tracing

If you want to run the OpenTelemetry stack and enable distributed tracing, start up the [tracing services](observability/jaeger/docker-compose.yml) (Jaeger).

This command is run separate from the above commands that start postgres/kafka. The networking between the two docker compose files is configured to allow them to communicate.

   ```bash
   ./gradlew tracingComposeUp
   ./gradlew tracingComposeDown
   ./gradlew tracingComposeDownForced
   ```

2. Validate Environment
   * Jaeger (Tracing UI) available at `http://localhost:16686`
   
Once the tracing backend is started, flip the [`tracingEnabled`](https://github.com/schroedermatt/data-demo/blob/main/gradle.properties#L5) flag to `true` in the root `gradle.properties` file before starting up the API or Daemon.

Want to run Grafana Tempo instead of Jaeger? Update the [tracing `dockerCompose` config](https://github.com/schroedermatt/data-demo/blob/main/build.gradle#L61-L65) in the root `build.gradle` to point to the tempo folder as shown below.

```groovy
tracing {
    useComposeFiles = [
            './observability/tempo/docker-compose.yml'
    ]
}
```

## Stream Processing

Ready to do something with this data? Go check out the [stream-processing-workshop](https://github.com/schroedermatt/stream-processing-workshop).

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Java Version

The following error is likely the cause of not having Java 21 installed.

```bash
> error: invalid source release: 21
```

### Windows Specific

./network.sh doesn't work

Ideally, use git bash to run the `./gradlew kafkaComposeUp`

OR

1. Create the network manually - `docker network create dev-local`
2. Comment out the `kafkaComposeUp.dependsOn dockerCreateNetwork` line in the root `build.gradle`
3. Run `./gradlew kafkaComposeUp`

### Linux Specific

1. add user to permission group to use docker (without sudo) 
   - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
2. install `docker-compose` manually: `sudo apt install docker-compose`
