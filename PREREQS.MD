    sdk install java 21.0.5-zulu
    sdk use java 21.0.5-zulu
    ```

## `jq` (optional)

`jq` is a command line tool that can format (and do many other things) JSON responses. It is really only needed if you plan to run the mockdata-api and call the API via curl.

curl -X POST localhost:8080/customers | jq
```
